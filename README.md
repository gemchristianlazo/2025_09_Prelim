# Machine Problems (MP1–MP7)

This repository contains my **C++ Machine Problems (MP1–MP7)** completed as part of my programming coursework. Each MP demonstrates different data structures, file handling, and linked list concepts.

## Overview of Machine Problems

- **MP1** – ADT List using **array of integers**
- **MP2** – ADT List using **array of structures** (`name, age`)
- **MP3** – ADT List using **linked list of integers**
- **MP4** – ADT List using **linked list of structures** (`name, age`)
- **MP5** – File handling for **MP2**, including **update feature**
- **MP6** – File handling for **MP4**, including **update feature**
- **MP7** – **Doubly linked list** of structures (`name, age`) with file handling

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
